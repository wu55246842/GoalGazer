      <h1>Editorial Policy</h1>
      <p>
        GoalGazer articles are generated from structured match data and reviewed
        for clarity. We prohibit fabricated claims, speculative tactical
        assertions, and any betting-related language.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each tactical claim includes an evidence list tied to available data
        fields. When evidence is incomplete, the article explicitly notes the
        limitation.
      </p>
      <p>
        We avoid copyrighted assets such as club crests or player imagery and
        instead publish neutral diagrams and text-based insights.
